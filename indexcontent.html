  <H3>Week 11</H3>
  <p>
	  <li> Progress Report
		<ul>
		<li> Activities
			<p>Over the last week I drew a schematic for a circuit board and I had it printed. I 
			   also added programs to my raspberry pi which allowed me to integrate the car with
			   the app my group members and I created for our software project.</p>
		</li>
		<li> Current Progress	
			<ol>
			<li><p>Seen below is the Circuit Board I drew and had printed</p> 
				<img src="documentation/DSC_0755.JPG" style="width:400px;height:400px;" >
			</li>	
			<li>
			<p>Before the end of this week I plan to solder headers onto the board and test it with the sensors and the car.</p>						
			</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li> Problems and Oppurtunities
			<p> The PCB was only printed on one side so using a drill bit I had to dig grooves around the holes on the
			unprinted side. *As of Thursday I am in posession of a new PCB which I redesigned based on the shortcomings
			of the previous one mentioned.</p>
			<p> All the sensor ports are on one side of the PCB so I have to find a way to place the sensors on all sides of
			the car while still connected to the PCB. I may also have to buy breadboards which was what I was trying to avoid
			doing in the first place.</p>
			<p>There seeems to be a short in the battery pack so I have to fix it when I get the chance. I'm also looking into
			using portable chargers to power the car like my group members have done.</p>
			<p>The programs we use to connect to the cars require wifi connection which hinder us from controlling the car
			wirelessly in the college. Considering writing code to use the bluetooth connection instead.</p>
			<p>Roberto briefly gave use advice at the open house on how to do the mapping and we've taken it into consideration</p>
		  
			</li>
		<li>Financial Status
			<p> Currently still on track. I haven't had to make any additional purchases nor do I forsee any in the near future.

  <p>
	  <li> Progress Report
		<ul>
		<li> Activities
			<p>This week I accomplished a few things. I powered up the PCB and tested its functionality with the raspberry pi.
			I also found code that can be used to move the car in a straight line. My current goal is to start putting parts 
			onto the car and testing the code using the raspberry Pi. Next Tuesday my team members and I will be meeting to
			share all of our research.</p>
		</li>
		<li> Current Progress	
			<ol>
			<li><p>Seen below is the car setup and connected to the Raspberry Pi and H-Bridge.</p> 
				<img src="documentation/setupcar.jpg" style="width:400px;height:400px;" >
			</li>	
			<li>
			<p>After making those connections I used the code to verify whether all the right connections were made. The result
			was both wheels on the left side moving. I'm currently in the process of making connections for the right wheels to move.</p>

	  <li> Activities versus Schedule
		<ol>
			<p>This week I completed my soldering of my Printed Circuit Board and went out to purchase the necessary parts for the project.</p>
			<p> Before completing these tasks I was lagging behind my partners, now everything is moving according to schedule</p>
		</ol>

	 <li> Current Progress

	<li> Problems and Oppurtunities

			<p>Problem: Was unable to purchase Car parts, used the class time to build the overdue PCB instead</p>
			<p>Problem: Went to purchase car parts and there was only one chassis left in stock. It came pre built so that obstacle was overcome but it may be faulty so I'll run tests on it.</p>
