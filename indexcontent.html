	  <li> Progress Report
		<ul>
		<li> Activities
			<p>This week I accomplished a few things. I powered up the PCB and tested its functionality with the raspberry pi.
			I also found code that can be used to move the car in a straight line. My current goal is to start putting parts 
			onto the car and testing the code using the raspberry Pi. Next Tuesday my team members and I will be meeting to
			share all of our research.</p>

		<li> Current Progress

			<li><p>Seen below is the car setup and connected to the Raspberry Pi and H-Bridge.</p>

			</li>	
			<li>
			<p>After making those connections I used the code to verify whether all the right connections were made. The result
			was both wheels on the left side moving. I'm currently in the process of making connections for the right wheels to move.</p>

	  <li> Activities versus Schedule
		<ol>
			<p>This week I completed my soldering of my Printed Circuit Board and went out to purchase the necessary parts for the project.</p>
			<p> Before completing these tasks I was lagging behind my partners, now everything is moving according to schedule</p>
		</ol>
		</li>
	 <li> Current Progress 
		  <ul>
			  <li>Purchased the following:</li>

	<li> Problems and Oppurtunities
		<ol>
			<p>Problem: Was unable to purchase Car parts, used the class time to build the overdue PCB instead</p>
			<p>Problem: Went to purchase car parts and there was only one chassis left in stock. It came pre built so that obstacle was overcome but it may be faulty so I'll run tests on it.</p>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li> Financial Status
		<ol>
			Budget adjusted to account for taxes and parts that were not previously included in initial budget.
