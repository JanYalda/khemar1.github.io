<h1>Project Proposal</h1>


<p>For our hardware project our team will be building an autonomous RC car. Through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi this car will connect to an android app which we will develop for this project. Through the app the user will be able to retrieve information from the car. An option will be available to allow the user to control the car itself using onscreen controls. The car will have sensors which will detect walls and other obstacles causing the car to change its course so as to avoid said obstacle. The car will map a certain area and it will send the mapped area to a data base which then can be retrieved by the app and displayed as a 2d map.</p>  
<p>Features:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The app will show the battery life and the distance the car has driven so far.</li>
  <li>The user will be required to login and it this information will be stored in a database. Each specific user’s information will be stored.</li>
  <li>It will be able to access and display statistics and other data through a database which the car sends the metadata and statistics to. For eg. A typical user’s login activity, which will retrieve the data that is related to that user</li> 
  <li>The app will have an easy to understand UI</li>
  <li>An onscreen controller option which will allow the user to control the car</li>
  <li>The app would support devices with Android KitKat 4.4(API 19) and above</li>
  <li>A settings menu</li>
  <li>Support for both English and French</li>
  <li>Image files with different resolutions for better quality on different devices</li> 
 </ul>
